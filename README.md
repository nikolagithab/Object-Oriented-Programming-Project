# Star-Application-Project
A Java program that can draw a 5-pointed star with radius 10. It calculates 10 points; 5 outer and 5 inner points. The outer points are obtained by rotating the top point (0,10) by 72 degrees repeatedly. The inner points are the intersection points from 2 line segments connecting teh outer points. The application implements class called Vector2 that defines a 2D point, and a class named Line that defines a 2D line. The Line class has a method, intersect() that determines an intersection point for two line segments.

Deliverables: Vector2.java, Line.java, App.java and Star.java.
This application uses OpenGL project to render interactive graphics on the screen.
